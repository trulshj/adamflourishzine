# FAQ

#### What is a zine?

In this context, a zine is an unofficial fanbook containing art and writing, created in collaboration with several people online.


#### Will this zine be digital or physical?

The zine will be produced as a physical 5.5” x 8.5” perfect bound zine alongside physical merchandise. The digital copy of the anthology will be available as well.


#### Who is your chosen charity?

All profits from this project will go towards Rainbow Railroad, a global non-profit organisation that helps LGBTQI+ people facing persecution based on their sexual orientation, gender identity & characteristics.
You can read more about their work here: [RainbowRailroad.org](https://www.rainbowrailroad.org) 


#### How will contributors be compensated?

All contributors will receive a digital PDF copy of the zine. We will also compensate contributors with a physical zine to those who would like to receive one as well as merchandise to their respective designers, regardless of pre-order success. We aim to compensate with free shipping and physical merchandise if pre-orders go well and our funds allow it.


#### Is there an age requirement for contributors?

Contributors must be 18 years old or above by the end of the application period.


#### How many contributors will be accepted?

We will be accepting 6-10 comic artists/creators, 6 fic/meta writers, 2-4 merch artists, and at least 2 spot artists. The numbers of spot artists and comic writers accepted will depend on the interest in collaborating for writers and comic artists respectively.
