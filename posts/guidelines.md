### Contributor Guidelines

##### Expectations for Final Piece(s)

All work has to be created for this project. All works have to be finished in time and submitted in proper formats. All work must be SFW and relate to the theme of Ainosuke’s growth and healing, featuring him in a post-canon setting. Contributors can also take inspiration from the accompanying concept of [“tomorrow is a new day”](/about).

Some examples of areas to explore post canon in relation to the theme include Ainosuke’s personal development, progress of his career in politics, development of S and his meaningful relationships with any character from Sk8 the Infinity following the finale of the series. Pre-canon content (i.e. child/teen Ainosuke) and canon content may be included as memories of the past or nostalgic items such as photos. For light ship content in comics and fics, any and all Adam ships are allowed as long as characters are appropriately aged up (adult x adult) and portrayed in a SFW way. They can be created in any Sk8 character’s POV as long as the work is relevant to Ainosuke’s growth and healing.

Visual aids like moodboards and color palettes will be available for all contributors. This is to provide a better understanding of the moods and concepts around the themes of blue hour and sunrise, and to help create a feel of continuity and coherency across the entire anthology.

##### Application Guidelines

Flourish is a project we have planned and considered with a set of moods, vibes, and concepts. There is a strong visual vision for this project, and therefore, we will be looking for certain traits when judging applicants. Color and lightning will be noted especially, as those are factors that strongly contribute to conveying moods and vibes of a piece. Interested applicants can apply to multiple positions. Please note that NSFW works are accepted during the application process.


For comic artists/creators: 

* At least one comic/comic page that show layout of the panels (can be with or without text)
* At least one character-centered piece, preferably with background (not just gradient/one color)
* Full-color and finished works that display your skill and show your style


Spot artists:

* At least one character-centered piece (backgrounds are optional)
* Full-color and finished works that display your skill and show your style


Additionally, Flourish will feature two double-page spreads conveying the themes of **blue hour** and **sunrise** respectively; for these, we will be looking for pieces that aren’t necessarily character centered, but that use composition, colors, and lightning to convey moods, themes, and concepts.
