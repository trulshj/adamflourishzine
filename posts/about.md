# ABOUT

Flourish is a for-charity fan anthology focusing on the healing and growth of Adam/Shindo Ainosuke from Sk8 the Infinity post canon. The anthology will feature short stories, meta writing, short comics and illustrations.

## Tomorrow is a new day

Accompanying the theme of healing and growth is the concept of "tomorrow is a new day," which puts emphasis on always having another chance to do better in the future. Whether the sleepless nights offer comfort or prompt angst to surface, Adam has the opportunity to reflect in private, away from the chaos in his life. Staying awake past blue hour to witness sunrise brings hope and solace that he can keep moving forward and eventually thrive.

Contributors will be welcome to explore this concept metaphorically and/or literally in their pieces if they wish.
